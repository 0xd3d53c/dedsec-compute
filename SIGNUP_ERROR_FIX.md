# Signup Error Fix: "Database error saving new user"

## Problem Description
Users were encountering a "Database error saving new user" error during the signup process. This error was preventing new users from joining the DedSecCompute network.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **conflicting database triggers** and **missing required fields**:

1. **Multiple Trigger Files**: There were several conflicting trigger files:
   - `scripts/002_create_profile_trigger.sql` (deleted)
   - `scripts/002_create_functions_and_triggers.sql` (deleted)
   - `scripts/003_create_invite_system.sql` (deleted)
   - `scripts/002_create_user_trigger.sql` (kept and fixed)

2. **Missing Required Fields**: The trigger was not providing all required fields:
   - `username` field was missing (required by schema)
   - `invite_code` generation was conflicting between triggers
   - Field mappings were incorrect

3. **Schema Mismatch**: The trigger was trying to insert into fields that didn't exist in the current schema.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cleaned Up Conflicting Files
- Removed `scripts/002_create_profile_trigger.sql`
- Removed `scripts/002_create_functions_and_triggers.sql`
- Removed `scripts/003_create_invite_system.sql`

### 2. Fixed the Main Trigger (`scripts/002_create_user_trigger.sql`)
- Added proper `username` field generation
- Ensured unique username generation with fallback
- Fixed field mappings to match current schema
- Added proper error handling and conflict resolution

### 3. Enhanced User Metadata
- Updated signup page to pass `username` in user metadata
- Ensured `display_name` is properly passed
- Added fallback values for missing data

### 4. Created Comprehensive Fix Script (`scripts/007_fix_user_creation.sql`)
- Drops all conflicting triggers and functions
- Creates clean, working trigger setup
- Includes verification steps
- Handles edge cases and conflicts

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```sql
-- Missing username field
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, display_name, invite_code)
VALUES (
  NEW.id,
  COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'email', NEW.email),
  COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'display_name', 'Anonymous User'),
  generate_invite_code()
)
```

### After (Fixed)
```sql
-- Complete with all required fields
INSERT INTO public.users (
  id, username, display_name, email, invite_code,
  is_admin, is_active, created_at, updated_at
)
VALUES (
  NEW.id,
  username_val,  -- Generated unique username
  display_name_val,
  email_val,
  public.generate_invite_code(),
  FALSE, TRUE, NOW(), NOW()
)
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `scripts/002_create_user_trigger.sql`
- Fixed trigger function to include all required fields
- Added unique username generation
- Improved error handling

### 2. `app/auth/signup/page.tsx`
- Added username generation in user metadata
- Ensured all required data is passed to trigger

### 3. `scripts/007_fix_user_creation.sql` (NEW)
- Comprehensive fix script for database setup
- Removes all conflicts
- Creates clean trigger environment

### 4. `scripts/008_test_user_creation.sql` (NEW)
- Verification script to test the fix
- Checks trigger and function existence
- Validates database structure

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Fix Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Connect to your Supabase database and run:
\i scripts/007_fix_user_creation.sql
```

### Option 2: Manual Application
1. Drop existing triggers: `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;`
2. Drop conflicting functions: `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user() CASCADE;`
3. Apply the fixed trigger from `scripts/002_create_user_trigger.sql`

### Option 3: Complete Reset
1. Drop all user-related triggers and functions
2. Run the complete database setup from scratch
3. Apply the fixed scripts in order

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix, verify it works:

1. **Check Trigger Exists**:
   ```sql
   SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
   ```

2. **Check Function Exists**:
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_name = 'handle_new_user';
   ```

3. **Test User Creation**:
   - Try creating a new user through the signup form
   - Check if the user appears in the `public.users` table
   - Verify all required fields are populated

4. **Run Test Script**:
   ```bash
   \i scripts/008_test_user_creation.sql
   ```

## Expected Results

After the fix:
- ✅ New users can sign up without database errors
- ✅ All required fields are properly populated
- ✅ Usernames are unique and properly generated
- ✅ Invite codes are generated correctly
- ✅ No more conflicting triggers or functions

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Keep only one trigger file per table
2. **Schema Validation**: Ensure triggers match current database schema
3. **Testing**: Test database changes before deployment
4. **Documentation**: Document all database triggers and their purposes
5. **Version Control**: Track database schema changes in version control

## Support

If you encounter any issues after applying this fix:

1. Check the database logs for specific error messages
2. Verify the trigger exists and is properly configured
3. Test the invite code generation function manually
4. Ensure all required database functions exist
5. Check for any remaining conflicting triggers

The fix should resolve the signup error completely and allow new users to join the DedSecCompute network successfully.
